DATA ANALYTICS EXAM
(PART OF THE VIEBEG HEAD-OF-TECHNOLOGY CANDIDATE-SEARCH PROCESS, FEB 2023, RWANDA)

## Directions:
A. Directions and task #0 are already posted, so please complete these at your earliest convenience, before the exam date. At ####h Kigali time, @@@day Feb ## 2023, the remaining tasks will be posted. Then you have a 1-hour "preparation period" to read the tasks and prepare. At ####h Kigali time, I will git-push the data file for this exam. Then you have a 2-hour "test period" to complete the rest of the tasks.  
B. All instructions will be pushed to the repo. I (Steven) will be available to answer questions by email (steven@viebeg.com) during preparation and test periods.  Hopefully I can answer all the questions during the preparation hour, but I will be available afterwards as well. Responses to any questions will be pushed as "Updates" to this "README.txt", below the tasks, so you may refresh this repo every 15 minutes or so to check for updates.
C. Perform the tasks in the order provided, without skipping. A candidate that did not complete all the tasks may still succeed. But if you can complete all of them within-time, done well, I will be impressed!
D. Tasks #1 and #2 should be done in a spreadsheet. (Google Sheets, Excel, or Libreoffice Calc). For the rest of the tasks, you can use any software or programming language you want.
E. After completing each task, make a git "commit" and "push" it to your solution repo (see tasks #s 0a, 0b, 0c).  If you want to make changes to the previous tasks later during the exam, that's fine -- I just want to see a minimum of one commit per task.  Include a useful/concise message for each commit of about one sentence or 5-to-15 words. Include all your data, code, and documentation in the repo: all your exam solution submissions should be in the repo.
F. Include thorough documentation/comments along with all code, including spreadsheets.  Documentation is a key part of the evaluation. You can include documentation as code comments, text in spreadsheet cells, or/and provide an additional text file "documentation.txt" of explanations/discussions, as you prefer.

Tasks:
0a. Create a new public git repo named "Viebeg_HoT_2023_02a_solution", and email a link to your new repo to steven@viebeg.com.
0b. Clone the repo https://github.com/viebeg-tech/HoT_2023_02a_exam.
0c. Get ready to "git pull" updates to viebeg-tech/HoT_2023_02a_exam.
[Remaining tasks to-be-provided at the beginning of the preparation period, at ####h Kigali time, @@@day, Feb ##, 2023.]

Notes and Updates:
