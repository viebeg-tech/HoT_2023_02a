DATA ANALYTICS EXAM
(PART OF THE VIEBEG HEAD-OF-TECHNOLOGY CANDIDATE-SEARCH PROCESS, FEB 2023, RWANDA)

## Directions:
1. **Exam timing**
    1. Directions and task #0 are already posted, so please review these and complete task #0 at your earliest convenience, before the exam date. 
    2. At ####h Kigali time, @@@day Feb ## 2023, the remaining tasks will be posted to this file "README.md". Then you have a 1-hour "preparation period" to read the tasks and prepare. 
    3. At ####h Kigali time, I will git-push the data file for this exam. Make sure you git-pull/refresh the repo at this time so you can get started. Then you have a 2-hour "test period" to complete the rest of the tasks.
    4. At ####h Kigali time, I will clone all of your repos, and I will use their state at that time to do evaluation.
2. **Instructions**
    1. All instructions will be pushed to this repo.
    2. If you have questions about the directions and task #0, welcome to ask me at your earliest convenience by email (steven@viebeg.com).
    3. I will be available to answer questions by email during preparation and test periods.  Hopefully I can answer all the questions during the preparation period, but I will be available during the test period as well.
    4. Responses to any questions will be pushed as "Updates" to this "README.txt", below the tasks, so you may refresh this repo every 15 minutes or so during the exam and preparation periods to check for updates.
3. **Sequence of tasks**
    1. Perform the tasks in the order provided, without skipping.
    2. A candidate that did not complete all the tasks may succeed.
    3. But if you can complete all of them within-time, done well, I will be impressed!
4. **Software and coding languages**
    1. Tasks #1 and #2 should be done in a spreadsheet. (Google Sheets, Excel, or Libreoffice Calc). 
    2. For the rest of the tasks, you can use any software or programming language you want.
5. **Submitting each task**
    1. After completing each task, make a git "commit" and "push" it to your solution repo (see tasks #s 0a, 0b, 0c).
    2. Don't wait until the end of the exam to push everything, push tasks as you complete them during the exam.
    3. If you want to make changes to the previous tasks later during the exam, that's fine -- I just want to be able to observe your working process, and see a minimum of one commit per task.  
    4. Include a useful/concise commit message for each commit of about one sentence or 5-to-15 words.
    5. Include all your data, code, and documentation in the repo: all your exam solution submissions should be in the repo.
6. **Documentation of work**
    1. Include thorough documentation/comments along with all your work, including code, spreadsheets, and especially manual edits (if any).  
    2. Documentation is a key part of the evaluation.
    3. You can include documentation as code comments and text in spreadsheet cells. If you want, you can provide an additional text file "documentation.txt" of explanations/discussions, as you prefer.

## Tasks:
